<p>
  This portfolio is created using <span>Gatsby</span> for its improved
  performance and SEO over plain React. The projects section content is
  implemented using <span>MDX</span> and is queried with <span>GraphQL</span>.
  The contact form uses <span>EmailJS</span> to create and send emails on the
  client-side.
