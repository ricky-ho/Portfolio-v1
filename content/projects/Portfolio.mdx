<p>
  This portfolio is created using <span>Gatsby</span> for its improved
  performance and SEO over plain React. The projects content is implemented
  using <span>MDX</span> and is queried and loaded in with <span>GraphQL</span>.
  The contact form functionality uses <span>EmailJS</span> to send emails
  without the need of a server or backend.
