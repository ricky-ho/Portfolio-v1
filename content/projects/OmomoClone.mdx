<p>
  A front-end, mobile-responsive, <span>ecommerce</span> web application
  inspired by <span>Omomo Tea Shoppe</span> that allows users to browse and shop
  from a menu of boba milk tea. The application includes basic shopping cart
  functionalities including adding and removing items from the shopping cart,
  which are persisted using the browser's LocalStorage. Users will also be able
  to modify drink add-ons or options, such as sweetness, ice-level, etc.
